!!! info

    The MicroProfile LRA specification does not include explicit information on whether it is possible to achieve high availability through methods like replication. Furthermore, the chosen runtime OpenLiberty, which includes the implementation for LRA, is still in a beta state[^1]. Therefore,
    their official documentation does not include information about MicroProfile LRA yet,
    which also means no information about a highly available system with it. Consequently,
    further tests would be necessary to be able to make a statement about high availability
    with MicroProfile LRA.
